In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. 
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends 
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy 
hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

And he had a pet; a rabbit that had an insatiable hunger for licorice.
It was his vice, he ate over a bag every day. 
Not some of the garbage Twizzlers stuff, that soft chewy licorice you can get at some gas stations.
It was his favorite, the hobbit told him, "Hey don't do that", and the rabbit said, "Nah".


The rabbit didnt take that too well. He punched the hobbit and 
Rand away of course. Not one soul could force the rabbit to 
Do anything. The rabbit got freedom and finally was able to be
Independent. No one. I repeat. No one was gonna boss that rabbit.
